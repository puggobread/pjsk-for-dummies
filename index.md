Welcome to my[^1] super professional guide on Project Sekai (PJSK, Proseka, etc.), or HATSUNE MIKU: COLORFUL STAGE!
From here, you can get (most) any information about the game and read to your heart's content. From the very basics and getting started, to tiering and ranked play. The guide will also define some terms that you might not know (get out those flashcards goober!!)

This guide is subject to change -- information can be updated at any time to be as helpful as possible. And if it isn't? Well you could probably look somewhere else for your answers.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, simply:

1. click "[use this template]" to create a GitHub repository
2. go to Settings > Pages > Build and deployment > Source, and select GitHub Actions

If you want to maintain your docs in the `docs` directory of an existing project repo, see [Hosting your docs from an existing project repo](https://github.com/just-the-docs/just-the-docs-template/blob/main/README.md#hosting-your-docs-from-an-existing-project-repo) in the template README.
